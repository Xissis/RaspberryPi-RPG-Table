This program allows you to create server to host your tokkens and maps(right now tokkens are just red dots not for dm-view) and view them on Raspberry Pi. Ideal when you want to use Raspberry Pi and old TV to create table for your RPG.
In the future I'm gonna add fog of war effect, tokkens view normaly - not as a red dots, but as an image you upload - and physics for lights.
